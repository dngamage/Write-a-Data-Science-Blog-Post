Here is the Medium blog post I have written: https://medium.com/p/5dc0ffb55530/edit

Project Motivation
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I have used Australian base the StarTravel Travel Agent company Data set for the blog post. As part of the StarTravel last 2 month(March and April in 2021) dataset will describes the Travelers Hotel search pattern and Travelers preferences. There are around 228346 search records in the dataset including full descriptions of Traveling key parameters.

This project focuses on answering following questions: 

What are the most popular destinations in the world ? 
What are the guess pattern combinations when renting Hotels?
What is the most popular stay period in Hotels?
What are the most popular departure dates during the next year?
What are the most influential features of the dataset to Predict next 6 month travelling  in the world ?
What can be predicted post COVID-19 ?

Libraries
I use Python3. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:

Numpy
Pandas
Sklearn
Seaborn
matplotlib.pyplot
Collections
Math
