Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Blog Post

### Medium Blog Post
Here is the Medium blog post I have written: https://medium.com/p/5dc0ffb55530/edit

### Installation
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

### Project Motivation
This project (Write a Data Science Blog Post) is part of Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program.

I have used Australian base of the StarTravel Travel Agent company Data set for the blog post. As part of the StarTravel last 2 month(March and April in 2021) dataset will describe the Travelers Hotel search pattern and Travelers preferences. There are around 228346 search records in the dataset including full descriptions of Traveling key parameters.

### This project focuses on answering following questions: 

- What are the most popular destinations in the world ? 
- What are the guess pattern combinations when renting Hotels?
- What is the most popular stay period in Hotels?
- What are the most popular departure dates during the future?
- What are the most influential features of the dataset to Predict next 6 month travelling  in the world ?


### Libraries
I use Python3. Here are the libraries I used in my Jupyter Notebook:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Sklearn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- Collections
- Math

### File Descriptions
startravel.csv contains the latest traveling details during the last 2 month(03/2021, 04/2021). Note that since data file is around 32MB it zip by winrar before upload.
There is also a notebook available here to showcase all my work related to all  questions.

Must give credit to Udacity courses for some of the code ideas, and to StarTravel  for the data.
